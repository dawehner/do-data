                "value": "<p>I think you summarised the reasons above pretty well in the issue summary. Many people believe the Druplicon is a good community mascot but not very professional or friendly for an \"enterprise software\" (also many people disagree). So it was made less important on the d.o front page in favor of the wordmark. The goals of the wordmark I believe were to have a Drupal logo that is \"enterprise friendly\" and \"not freely modifiable\" (compared to the Druplicon that is licensed under the GPL and is therefore free to change/adapt as people wish).</p>\n<p>Here it is in Mark Boulton's words from <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20100119002709/http://www.markboultondesign.com/news/detail/why_do_we_need_a_new_logo_anyway\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://web.archive.org/web/20100119002709/http://www.markboultondesign.c...</a> (the URL itself is not accessible anymore):</p>\n<blockquote><h3>Why do we need a new logo anyway?</h3>\n<p>Following the latest post, it was clear that there has not been enough explanation, or discussion around why Drupal needs a new logo.\n</p>\n<h3>We need the fish</h3>\n<p>\nA few of weeks ago in Szeged, I sat down with <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20100119002709/http://www.garfieldtech.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Larry</a>, to discuss some of the finer points of the \u2018branding\u2019 deliverables that were indicated in the RFP process. He explained that Drupal needed a new logo that could be trademarked, in order to protect itself legally. Druplicon can\u2019t be trademarked because of it is <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20100119002709/http://drupal.org/node/9068\" rel=\"nofollow\">licensed under GPL</a>. Those are the business reasons for doing so. Larry\u2019s <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20100119002709/http://www.garfieldtech.com/blog/drupal-org-logo-trademark\" rel=\"nofollow\">latest blog post</a> goes a long way in explaining why this item appeared on RFP, and why my firm was briefed to undertake the work as part of the d.o redesign.\n</p>\n<blockquote><p>But Druplicon can\u2019t be that playful community spirit as an official logo. Official logos more rules they have to follow, both marketing-wise and legally. If Druplicon were the Official Logo Of Drupal(tm), it would have to be trademarked. Random fish would be harder to do, as we\u2019d run the risk of it hurting the trademark\u2019s standing. We couldn\u2019t use it as the default \u201clogo\u201d graphic on new Drupal installs.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\nLarry goes on to say:\n</p>\n<blockquote><p>No, Druplicon is not a logo. It is a mascot that we\u2019ve been using as a logo. Think Tux the Linux Penguin. Or think the <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20100119002709/http://www.nexen.net/elephpant.php\" rel=\"nofollow\">elePHPant</a>, which is distinct from the actual <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20100119002709/http://us3.php.net/images/logos/php-med-trans-light.gif\" rel=\"nofollow\">PHP logo</a>. As a mascot, we can have cookies.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\nThese are sound business reasons on why Drupal needs a logo, separate from the Druplicon. But, aside from that, why do I personally think it\u2019s time the Drupal logo had some attention?\n</p>\n<h3>What\u2019s wrong with FF Max?</h3>\n<p>\nThis question has cropped up a lot. Not only with the community, but with the DA as well. Why am I suggesting we change it? Without Druplicon tied to the logo (as it can\u2019t be for the reasons Larry stated), then we\u2019re left with FF Max.\n</p>\n<p>\nPersonally, I\u2019ve got the following reasons for suggesting the change:\n</p>\n<p></p><ul class=\"bulletlist\"><li>What makes FF Max interesting are the small details in the letters. However, at small size, those details degrade. At about 12pt and below, FF Max doesn\u2019t look all that distinctive.</li>\n<li>Most display typefaces are designed to solve a specific purpose (a lot of text faces too, like <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20100119002709/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FF_Meta\" rel=\"nofollow\">FF Meta</a>, <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20100119002709/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frutiger\" rel=\"nofollow\">Frutiger</a>, or <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20100119002709/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnston_(typeface)\" rel=\"nofollow\">Johnston</a>).

                "value": "<p>Oh man, thank you for initiating this! I've been saying Druplicon needs an overhaul for years, but no time, blah blah\u2026 Here are a few thoughts on this topic.</p>\n<p>- First, and probably most important: Druplicon is no longer Drupal's logo. It's been replaced by the wordmark (<a href=\"https://drupal.org/drupal-media-kit\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://drupal.org/drupal-media-kit</a>). It's not \"sort of been pushed out of central drupal branding\", it's <em>officially</em> out. It's now a mascot. It has also become a kind of symbol for the community and the people within it. And this is good news, first because as you explained with great detail it's outdated, and secondly it means we have a lot more freedom.</p>\n<p>- There is still a lot of confusion between the logo (wordmark) and the mascot (Druplicon). Even in the official media kit some pages are a outdated and still show Druplicon as the logo. And hell! The favicon for Drupal.org is still Druplicon\u2026 No wonder that for many people Druplicon is still the logo. This could be a good opportunity to explain the difference clearly once and for all.</p>\n<p>- As it's now a mascot, I don't think we need to limit its representation to just <em>one</em> image. It's a character, it should live it's life, it's not an untouchable historic piece of art in a museum.<br />\nFor years people have adapted/transformed/butchered it for the better or the worse. Drupal Camp designers have shown great creativity, and should be able to keep doing this. I think my favorite is the reversed Druplicon / bee from Drupal Camp Manchester (<a href=\"https://camp2012.nwdrupal.org.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://camp2012.nwdrupal.org.uk/</a>) :)</p>\n<p>- I've always found the general shape awkward. A big circle with a tiny spike, it feels disproportionate to me, it's a difficult shape to work with, and quite frankly, I don't think the shape alone really looks like a drop.<br />\nI think we should drop (ha!) the old graphic entirely and create a modern looking character based on the same basic elements: drop shape, eyes, smile (we can skip the nose) with a different overall style. Not sure we should keep the infinite loop in the eyes because first it's in large part responsible for the nasty/malicious look, and secondly I think few people notice it.</p>\n<p>* The general shape could look more like a drop<br />\n* It should be easier to draw and modify than today's Druplicon. Infinite loops are hard to nail!<br />\n* Not sure we need an official color<br />\n* Simple shapes FTW!<br />\n* Can we make it a kind of smiley, with different expressions?</p>\n<p>- For what it's worth, here's a drop shape I created that has been used for several French Drupal Camps (like <a href=\"http://paris2013.drupalcamp.fr/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://paris2013.drupalcamp.fr/</a> and <a href=\"http://paris2011.drupalcamp.fr/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://paris2011.drupalcamp.fr/</a>) and also for Drupal Design Camp / Frontend United graphics and t-shirts (<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/elv/9441041093/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.flickr.com/photos/elv/9441041093/</a>)<br />\nSVG file here: <a href=\"http://elv.free.fr/pub/drupal/drop.svg\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://elv.free.fr/pub/drupal/drop.svg</a></p>\n<p><img src=\"/files/drop_1.png\" alt=\"Drops\" /></p>"

It's far more recognisable than the Drupal wordmark, imagine if you wrote a different word in that <em>'typeface'</em> no one would go \"that's like the drupal logo\", whereas all the crazy different versions of druplicon are still highly recognisable as being drupal related, and I agree that inverted bumble bee one is a great example. I think that's because druplicon is fundamentally a very good logo - granted it's dated, yadda yadda, but the essence is very sound i think.</p>\n<p>For starters I'm coming at this with the intention of achieving something manageable... 'revise' the current logo, as much as I would love to redesign it completely I think there would be massive objections to it.</p>\n<p>That's definitely a really nice droplet shape, and excellent for drupal camps and so on. Is there a semi-official set of assets for making drupal camp logos? I think it would be good if there was, not so much \"these are the assets you have to use\", more like \"here's some helpful files to get you started, feel free to add more of your own\"</p>\n<p>I think the bare minimum for the drupal logo is a droplet, and the eyes. Personally I'm not too bothered if the eyes look like an infinity symbol or not, or that people look at it and think, \"wow, must be infinitely flexible\"  but I think those 2 elements are what makes it a strong logo.</p>\n<p>Now it may well be that a Drupal logo isn't actually druplicon the smiling droplet, but for now that's what i'm concerning myself with</p>"

From a brand identity standpoint, it makes sense to use the existing Drupal wordmark similar to the Drupal 7 treatment. As elv points out, departing from the Drupal wordmark would cause confusion. I also wanted to make sure to communicate that the Druplicon is not within the scope of the launch work we're doing with Drupal 8, so any update to the Druplicon can happen separately at a different pace, and as the group here sees fit. </p>\n<p>As this discussion highlights, there is probably a broader discussion and subsequent documentation that should happen at some point that clearly and officially defines the role of the Druplicon (mascot vs. official logo, etc.) and the Drupal wordmark. </p>\n<p>I'm looking forward to following the discussion here and, again, helping however I can.

So my aim is to revise the graphic, not to kill off Druplicon.</p>\n<p>I've been very careful to produce a set of variations which are very true to the current version, I'm not saying we have to ditch the nose and mouth, I'm saying that from a graphical logo designers perspective the essential elements are the eyes and body shape.</p>\n<p>I'm also putting forward the idea that the eyes on the current logo aren't actually symmetrical in 3d, and they are a bit of a funky shape at the bottom, so let's make it a little better.</p>\n<p>The highlights can go back in, I just didn't want to complicated the proposed 'shapes'.</p>"

Make our mascot a real mascot.<br />\n- if the Drop is alive n well, well lets give it. hats n mustards, wands, lip, wigs whatever on - so it can turn into a fun character we can use for whatever - think TUX with a cowboy hat. We tried to do that around DrupalCon cph 3 years ago. It worked out pretty good as a gimmick thing.<br />\nWe have had a ton of request of reuse of em later on.</p>\n<p>2. Make a more simplyfied version of a drop.<br />\naka Something that will work in a 16 x 16 px version (yes the favicon) - i think that elv's simplyfied drop is pretty much spot on. Its clean its reusable can be done in many versions &amp; keeps the feel of a Drop alive.</p>\n<p>Should we call a BOF for next week in Prague ? ;)</p>"

This was quite a successful strategy in building image and lasts to this day.</p>"

Or whatever, there are times when you might want to portray that Drupal is different, it's futuristic, and it's flipping badass :) this illustration is for those times.</p>\n<p>@pounard: yeah the drop shape is nice and clean, and is really useful in other situations, I think it's a great idea to have a kind of official droplet shape for other logos to use as a base.

And thanks for recognising that even if you don't like something it can still be an awesome piece of work :)</p>\n<p>@echoz: thanks for that, the light outline is kinda jarring somehow isn't it. It's only there when you have the blue drop on the blue background. #42 was my attempt at a really minimal svg style graphic (not something I traditionally do). Removing the nose and mouth met some resistance, and there's some pretty major things I don't like about it. But I do still think that the 2 core elements to our logo are the drop, and the eyes, and getting those 2 things 'right' is really tricky.</p>\n<p>I was chatting to a mate about it last night and I came to realise what im trying to get at...if you picture Druplicon as your website, the 2004 logo is like your default install. Then you add some modules, and a nice theme, and you have a professional looking site, bit more like the d7 above. But Drupal is so flexible, and so powerful, that you can strip it down, bolt bits on, custom theme it, etc etc, then the Rengade Druplicon might be what I end up with on my site, and there would be more of these highly detailed custom Druplicons... For all the different things you can build...</p>\n<p>Anyway I'm rambling on, I might go make some graphics :)</p>"

The reason why I personally (and my guess is that all others that feel the same) oppose the 3D ideas is that because we have in mind the logo that will be in the installer, the front page after each installation in the Seven theme as well as here in d.o. It's just that we need something more \"plain\" as the product \"official\" logo. Something in the spirit of <a href=\"#comment-7720229\" rel=\"nofollow\">#10</a> or <a href=\"#comment-7857029\" rel=\"nofollow\">#42</a> or what is in the issue summary at the time of writing this (personal favorite is the \"E\" series with the \"fading\" border instead of the \"A\" and \"G\" series with the white one that makes it look like a sticker).</p>\n<p>Just my 0.02$</p>\n<p>PS: Logo competitions for DrupalCons is a great idea to establish like voting for the next place that will be considered for DrupalCons.</p>"

You also make an interesting point about the web moving more towards 3d again.</p>\n<p>I'm really confused by all is talk of mascot's, must be an american thing. My idea of a mascot is the dude wearing the team mascot suit at a baseball game. The baseball team may have a logo with that mascot on it... But the graphical representation of the mascot is a logo. As I understand it.</p>\n<p>Anyway, have fun at that bof I'll be about 15,000 km away</p>"

Pity to pass up the opportunity to have an eight / infinity / eyes logo all in one...  Actually lets not get off topic.</p>\n<p>You're absolutely right that this issue is about Druplicon... All the other graphics, like the 'Drupal 8' etc are just for decoration.</p>\n<p>So the blue droplet Druplicon is very svg'able - it's not obviously lit from one side, it kept the nose and mouth, which hopefully don't look like a big open mouth.... It's the colors from d.o header.... And I'm about 75% happy with it.</p>\n<p>Anyone got any thoughts?</p>"

I think it looks better more front on, and I think the mouth and possibly the nose need to be slightly thicker.</p>\n<p>The line on the eyes is half a stroke, just because I did it quickly and the eyes are on top... Interesting idea to play with the white space.</p>\n<p>I think there's still quite a bit of work to do on the face, but this is the first one I've been happy enough with to show, there have been a few versions that sucked.</p>\n<p>But yeah, you can render straight from blender to svg, I think animated svg works as well but I didn't try.</p>\n<p>@bojhan, what do you think about the alteration I made to the nose and mouth? </p>\n<p>Have fun at the bof today</p>"

                "value": "<p>I agree with #96 and #100, I'd like to focus on updating the  requirements/constraints that we can agree are important so that suggestions can be reviewed more objectively against rather than limiting creativity by proposing \"solutions\" based on current trends.</p>\n<p>I do still think it's important that we can represent the logo in a scalable format, such as SVG - this is *harder* but not impossible with 3D renders on small scales (like a favicon). This is already stated in the issue summary as an important consideration.</p>\n<p>I do still think that it's important that the logo is comprehensible and approachable to as many people as possible, not just people who have worked with it for years and not just developers - this is *harder* but not impossible when you start putting eyeballs on things as you start wandering into \"uncanny valley\" type considerations (Github's Octocat has other body parts beyond eyeballs - I'd say the usual reaction to the Github mascot is \"that's cute!\" not \"oh, ok... a blue spaceman\"). I think it's sort of funny that we're apparently OK with human eye balls that are horrifically mutated to the point of being fused across the middle into a single, giant mono-eye but not something that looks vaguely like a shark fin. \"The Drupal icon is weird looking and dated\" is a *common* criticism of Drupal's branding that I have seen in Drupal's own IRC channels, have heard time and time again at meetups (not just Drupal meetups), from clients, friends, etc... Again, this is already stated as a primary weakness of the current logo in this issue's summary, in fact the weirdness and unapproachableness of the logo make up 5 of the 8 stated main weaknesses in the summary.</p>\n<p>I also think it's a rather masculine looking logo, which isn't great for fostering an encouraging feeling of inclusiveness. The female renders in #52 and #53 are a bit extreme for my taste, but they do highlight that whether consciously or subconsciously, there are people out there who identify with the current Drupal logo as \"a male thing\". I feel this probably could be added as a weakness in the issue summary, but I'm curious to see whether others agree.</p>\n<p>The issue summary itself *opens* with the premise that the Druplicon has been steadily becoming less relevant and marginalised over the last *9 years*, providing clear evidence/examples.</p>\n<p>The main arguments I have heard (feel free to provide other arguments, I'm actually quite open to discussing this) in defence of the idea of the blue-drop-space-man as an immutable part of Drupal's branding are:</p>\n<p>- That's just how it has always been and so how it must always continue to be<br />\n- Other successful products have logos that people find weird too (which is not the same argument as other successful branding has weird logos, arguably linux suffers from terrible branding/marketing/public perception issues compared to both Mac and Windows, which I think a lot of linux advocates tend to forget easily simply because linux itself is a great product, and this is a great example of what NOT to do if you're looking for mainstream acceptance)<br />\n- I don't personally find it off-putting/I don't accept or am suspicious of other people's claims that it is off-putting, there must be some ulterior motive there<br />\n- Anyone who doesn't \"get it\" is wrong somehow and if they just got to know Drupal more they'd love it exactly as much as I do<br />\n- People who do identify with the current logo would be incapable of accepting a change and will almost certainly like any and every other possible logo idea less, so we shouldn't even try to consider alternatives because they're guaranteed to be worse<br />\n- \"It's subjective\" and so any logo can be justified, even if \"some minority of people\" are pointing out issues in how it presents and what it represents</p>\n<p>Arguments I have NOT yet heard from anybody defending the blue-drop-space-man:</p>\n<p>- A blue-drop-space-man is clearly aligned with the community's goals, ideals and achievements because it represents X (I can see how the droplet metaphor works, but why the spaceman face? I could see other non-droplet metaphors working but that would be a much larger departure from tradition)<br />\n- There are clear statistics showing that other products/brands with stylised/mutated blue human heads perform well in the market<br />\n- If I were to invent a logo/mascot for Drupal today, in a world where it did not already have one, I'd probably choose a blue-drop-space-man after carefully considering all other options</p>\n<p>I totally agree that \"because tradition\" is a valid argument when talking about logos and branding because you obviously don't want to throw away all your existing brand juice, but it's not the only consideration either and the graphics in #99 show that things can change and evolve over time too. If we did have a clear long-term branding goal (like, \"less anthropomorphic\" or \"less masculine\") we could always plan to iterate the branding towards that goal over multiple years in a way that allowed people to adjust their expectations gradually.</p>\n<p>We absolutely do have a vested interest in being taken seriously and being viewed positively by people who are outside our existing community, and not \"because of clients\" (although clients are important too, the community owes a huge amount to the buy-in from clients). One of the main things I keep hearing from the D8 spruikers about is that this release represents a global scale attempt from our community to try to become more inviting and approachable to people outside our existing members - \"getting off the island\" as they say. I don't see much difference philosophically between wanting to embrace technologies that other PHP developers see as valuable, like Symfony, and wanting to embrace the aesthetics and branding ideals that other major open source PHP (and non-PHP) communities have decided to adopt.</p>\n<p>The \"flat design\" thing was more about me suggesting a solution to the above, but forget I said anything about it as it's only tangental to the main points I wanted to raise.</p>"
