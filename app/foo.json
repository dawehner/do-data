I\u0027ve been saying Druplicon needs an overhaul for years, but no time, blah blah\u2026 Here are a few thoughts on this topic.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E- First, and probably most important: Druplicon is no longer Drupal\u0027s logo.

It has also become a kind of symbol for the community and the people within it. And this is good news, first because as you explained with great detail it\u0027s outdated, and secondly it means we have a lot more freedom.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E- There is still a lot of confusion between the logo (wordmark) and the mascot (Druplicon). Even in the official media kit some pages are a outdated and still show Druplicon as the logo. And hell! The favicon for Drupal.org is still Druplicon\u2026 No wonder that for many people Druplicon is still the logo. This could be a good opportunity to explain the difference clearly once and for all.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E- As it\u0027s now a mascot, I don\u0027t think we need to limit its representation to just \u003Cem\u003Eone\u003C\/em\u003E image. It\u0027s a character, it should live it\u0027s life, it\u0027s not an untouchable historic piece of art in a museum.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\nFor years people have adapted\/transformed\/butchered it for the better or the worse. Drupal Camp designers have shown great creativity, and should be able to keep doing this.

But Drupal is so flexible, and so powerful, that you can strip it down, bolt bits on, custom theme it, etc etc, then the Rengade Druplicon might be what I end up with on my site, and there would be more of these highly detailed custom Druplicons...

Again, this is already stated as a primary weakness of the current logo in this issue\u0027s summary, in fact the weirdness and unapproachableness of the logo make up 5 of the 8 stated main weaknesses in the summary.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI also think it\u0027s a rather masculine looking logo, which isn\u0027t great for fostering an encouraging feeling of inclusiveness. The female renders in #52 and #53 are a bit extreme for my taste, but they do highlight that whether consciously or subconsciously, there are people out there who identify with the current Drupal logo as \u0022a male thing\u0022.

I could see other non-droplet metaphors working but that would be a much larger departure from tradition)\u003Cbr \/\u003E\n- There are clear statistics showing that other products\/brands with stylised\/mutated blue human heads perform well in the market\u003Cbr \/\u003E\n- If I were to invent a logo\/mascot for Drupal today, in a world where it did not already have one, I\u0027d probably choose a blue-drop-space-man after carefully considering all other options\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI totally agree that \u0022because tradition\u0022 is a valid argument when talking about logos and branding because you obviously don\u0027t want to throw away all your existing brand juice, but it\u0027s not the only consideration either and the graphics in #99 show that things can change and evolve over time too. If we did have a clear long-term branding goal (like, \u0022less anthropomorphic\u0022 or \u0022less masculine\u0022) we could always plan to iterate the branding towards that goal over multiple years in a way that allowed people to adjust their expectations gradually.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWe absolutely do have a vested interest in being taken seriously and being viewed positively by people who are outside our existing community, and not \u0022because of clients\u0022 (although clients are important too, the community owes a huge amount to the buy-in from clients). One of the main things I keep hearing from the D8 spruikers about is that this release represents a global scale attempt from our community to try to become more inviting and approachable to people outside our existing members - \u0022getting off the island\u0022 as they say. I don\u0027t see much difference philosophically between wanting to embrace technologies that other PHP developers see as valuable, like Symfony, and wanting to embrace the aesthetics and branding ideals that other major open source PHP (and non-PHP) communities have decided to adopt.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe \u0022flat design\u0022 thing was more about me suggesting a solution to the above, but forget I said anything about it as it\u0027s only tangental to the main points I wanted to raise.\u003C\/p\u003E","format":"1"},"field_attribute_contribution_to":[],"field_for_customer":[],"field_attribute_as_volunteer":[],"flag_drupalorg_comment_spam_user":[],"cid":"9166243","name":"thedavidmeister","homepage":"","subject":"","url":"https:\/\/www.drupal.org\/node\/2057767#comment-9166243","edit_url":"https:\/\/www.drupal.org\/comment\/edit\/9166243","created":"1411277741","node":{"uri":"https:\/\/www.drupal.org\/api-d7\/node\/2057767","id":"2057767","resource":"node"},"author":{"uri":"https:\/\/www.drupal.org\/api-d7\/user\/657782","id":"657782","resource":"user"}}]}
